# auGraph: Graphs for Relational and Tabular Learning
Tamara Cucumides, Floris Geerts

## Prepare your data
auGraph supports both tabular and relational data
* For relational data, each table must be stored in a separate .csv. Additionally, a .json file must be filled. A sample is provided [in this link](https://github.com/TamaraCucumides/auGraph/tree/main/data/toy).
* For tabular data, it suffices to be able to load the data into a pandas dataframe. Fron that point on, you can follow [this sample code](https://github.com/TamaraCucumides/auGraph/blob/main/experiments/e2-tabular-data.py)
  
## Run experiments
Scripts to run experiments is provided [in the experiments folder](https://github.com/TamaraCucumides/auGraph/tree/main/experiments)
